Today, I uploaded colorconsole99 on GitHub for the first time, version 1.0.0 .
This is my first self-made library, but it is not ready to be released on pypi  :)
You can copy the master file directly to the python Library Directory.

Today, I canceled the complex colors class, which can be called directly without executing "colorconsole99. Colors. [XXX]"
This is only a beta version
