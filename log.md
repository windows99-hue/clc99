Today, I uploaded colorconsole99 on GitHub for the first time, version 1.0.0 .
This is my first self-made library, but it is not ready to be released on pypi  :)

You can copy the master file directly to the python Library Directory.

Today is an exciting day. Just yesterday, I used my own library, but I found that I couldn't install it because there was a major bug in my program. 

Today, I fixed it and everything was normal! You can use pip to install. It also has a new version number: 1.0.1.1

Today, I have made up my mind to refactor colorconsole99. I have changed the name of this library to clc99, which is more convenient. I have also removed unnecessary libraries and simplified the program structure. I will also upload it again, not only on GitHub, but clc99 will also work on Pypi!

Today, I added the 'end' parameter to clc99 and also refactored the code structure of the library
